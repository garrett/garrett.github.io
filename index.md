# Hi, I’m Garrett.

## Welcome to my humble little website.

I am a UX/UI designer and have been focusing on libré / open source
software since 1996.

Photography is one of the things I do for fun. [See photos I've taken on Flickr](http://flickr.com/garrett).

I have [things on github](https://github.com/garrett), 
including [a nice vector Tux](https://github.com/garrett/Tux).

[I'm pretty active on Twitter](http://twitter.com/garrett).
Feel free to [contact me there](http://twitter.com/home?status=@garrett:+).
