# Hi, I’m Garrett.

I am a designer and have been focusing on libré / open source
software since 1996.

In my free time, I like to practice photography.
You can [see my photos on Flickr](http://flickr.com/garrett).

Design, photography, and
nerdy/geeky stuff is interesting. I save
[bookmarks of these topics I find on Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:garrett).

I have [things on github](https://github.com/garrett), 
including [a nice vector Tux](https://github.com/garrett/Tux).

[I'm pretty active on Twitter](http://twitter.com/garrett).
Feel free to
[contact me there](http://twitter.com/home?status=@garrett:+).
